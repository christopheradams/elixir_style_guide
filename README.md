Style matters. Elixir has plenty of style but like all languages it can be
stifled.  Don't stifle the style.

**NOTE**: From here on out, you get a PR merged, you get added as a
collaborator. People who have PRs merged have been added as collaborators.


# The Elixir Style Guide

This is my attempt at starting a community style guide for Elixir. Please feel
free to make pull requests and contribute. I really want Elixir to have as
vibrant of a community as any language that's been around five times as long.

If you're looking for other projects to contribute to please see Elixir's wiki
page with [list of projects] or [hex package manager site].

## Source Code Layout

<!-- TODO: Add crafty quote here -->

* Use two **spaces** per indentation level. No hard tabs.

```elixir
# not preferred - four spaces
def some_function do
    do_something
end

# preferred
def some_function do
  do_something
end
```

* Use Unix-style line endings (\*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by
  default, Windows users have to be extra careful).

    * If you're using Git you might want to add the following configuration
      setting to protect your project from Windows line endings creeping in:

```bash
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons. Do not put
  spaces around matched pairs like brackets, parenthesis, etc. Whitespace might
  be (mostly) irrelevant to the Elixir runtime, but its proper use is the key to
  writing easily readable code.

```elixir
sum = 1 + 2
{a, b} = {2, 3}
Enum.map(["one", <<"two">>, "three"], fn num -> IO.puts num end)
```

* Use empty lines between `def`s and to break up a function into logical
  paragraphs...

```elixir
def some_function(some_data) do
  altered_data = Module.function(data)
end

def some_function do
  result
end

def some_other_function do
  another_result
end

def a_longer_function do
  one
  two

  three
  four
end
```

* ...but run single-line `def`s that match for the same function together.

```elixir
def some_function(nil), do: {:err, "No Value"}
def some_function([]), do: :ok
def some_function([first|rest]) do
  some_function(rest)
end
```

* If you have more than one multi-line `def`s do not use single-line `def`s.

```elixir
def some_function(nil) do
  {:err, "No Value"}
end

def some_function([]) do
  :ok
end

def some_function([first|rest]) do
  some_function(rest)
end

def some_function([first|rest], opts) do
  some_function(rest, opts)
end
```

* Use the pipeline operator (`|>`) to chain functions together.

```elixir
# not preferred
String.strip(String.downcase(some_string))

# preferred
some_string |> String.downcase |> String.strip

# Multiline pipelines use a single level of indentation.
some_string
|> String.downcase
|> String.strip
```

While this is the preferred method, take into account that copy pasting
multiline pipelines into IEX might result in a syntax error as IEX will evaluate
the first line without realizing that the next line has a pipeline.

* Use _bare_ variables in the first part of a function chain.

```elixir
# THE WORST!
# This actually parses as String.strip("nope" |> String.downcase).
String.strip "nope" |> String.downcase

# not preferred
String.strip(some_string) |> String.downcase |> String.codepoints

# preferred
some_string |> String.strip |> String.downcase |> String.codepoints
```

* Avoid trailing whitespace.

## Syntax

* Use parentheses when you have arguments, no parentheses when you don't.

```elixir
# not preferred
def some_function arg1, arg2 do
  # body omitted
end

def some_function() do
  # body omitted
end

# preferred
def some_function(arg1, arg2) do
  #body omitted
end

def some_function do
  # body omitted
end
```

* Never use `do:` for multi-line `if/unless`.

```elixir
# not preferred
if some_condition, do:
  # a line of code
  # another line of code
  # note no end in this block

# preferred
if some_condition do
  # some
  # lines
  # of code
end
```

* Use `do:` for single line `if/unless` statements.

```elixir
# preferred
if some_condition, do: # some_stuff
```


* Never use `unless` with `else`. Rewrite these with the positive case first.

```elixir
# not preferred
unless success? do
  IO.puts 'failure'
else
  IO.puts 'success'
end

# preferred
if success? do
  IO.puts 'success'
else
  IO.puts 'failure'
end
```

* Never put a space between a function name and the opening parenthesis.

```elixir
# not preferred
f (3 + 2) + 1

# preferred
f(3 + 2) + 1
```

* Use parentheses in function calls, especially inside a pipeline.

```elixir
# not preferred
f 3

# preferred
f(3)

# not preferred and parses as f(3 |> g), which is not what you want
f 3 |> g

# preferred
f(3) |> g()
```

* Omit parentheses in macro calls when a do block is passed.

```elixir
# not preferred
quote(do
  foo
end)

# preferred
quote do
  foo
end
```

* Optionally omit parentheses in function calls (outside a pipeline) when the
  last argument is a function expression.

```elixir
# preferred
Enum.reduce(1..10, 0, fn x, acc ->
  x + acc
end)

# also preferred
Enum.reduce 1..10, 0, fn x, acc ->
  x + acc
end
```

## Naming

* Use `snake_case` for atoms, functions and variables.

```elixir
# not preferred
:"some atom"
:SomeAtom
:someAtom

someVar = 5

def someFunction do
  ...
end

def SomeFunction do
 ...
end

# preferred
:some_atom

some_var = 5

def some_function do
  ...
end
```

* Use `CamelCase` for modules (Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase).

```elixir
# not preferred
defmodule Somemodule do
  ...
end

defmodule Some_Module do
  ...
end

defmodule SomeXml do
  ...
end

# preferred
defmodule SomeModule do
  ...
end

defmodule SomeXML do
  ...
end
```

* The names of predicate functions (a function that return a boolean value)
  should have a trailing question mark rather than a leading `is_` or similar.

```elixir
def cool?(var) do
  # checks if var is cool
end
```

## Comments

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section. Seriously!
* Use one space between the leading `#` character of the comment and the text of
  the comment.
* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation. Use
  [one space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.

```elixir
# not preferred
String.upcase(some_string) # Capitalize string.
```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date. An outdated comment is worse than no
  comment at all.
* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code. Refactor the code to make it
  self-explanatory. (Do or do not - there is no try. --Yoda)

### Comment Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above the
  relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent lines
  should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would be
  redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line with no
  note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.


* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be added at a
  later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause performance
  problems.
* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices were used
  and should be refactored away.
* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it is
  working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the client
  does X currently?`
* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be sure to
  document them in your project's `README` or similar.

## Modules

* Use one module per file unless the module is only used internally by another
  module (such as a test).
* Use underscored file names for `CamelCase` module names.

```elixir
# file is called some_module.ex

defmodule SomeModule do
end
```

* Represent each level of nesting within a module name as a directory.

```elixir
# file is called parser/core/xml_parser.ex

defmodule Parser.Core.XMLParser do
end
```
* No newline after defmodule
* No newline before first function def
* Newline after "module-level-code-blocks"


## Exceptions

## Collections

## Strings

## Regular Expressions

## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.

# Contributing

It's my hope that this will become a central hub for community discussion on
best practices in Elixir. Feel free to open tickets or send pull requests with
improvements. Thanks in advance for your help!

# Attribution

The structure of this guide, bits of example code, and many of the initial
points made in this document were borrowed from the
[Ruby community style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).  A
lot of things were applicable to Elixir and allowed me to get _some_ document
out quicker to start the conversation.


# Spread the Word

A community style guide is meaningless without the community's support.  Please
Tweet, star, and let any Elixir programmer know about this guide so they can
contribute.

Style matters.
[Elixir] has plenty of style but like all languages it can be stifled.
Don't stifle the style.

**NOTE**: From here on out, you get a PR merged, you get added as a
collaborator.
People who have PRs merged have been added as collaborators.


# [The Elixir Style Guide][Elixir Style Guide]

This is our attempt at starting a community style guide for the
[Elixir programming language][Elixir].
Please feel free to make pull requests and contribute.
We really want Elixir to have as vibrant of a community as any language that's
been around five times as long.

## Source Code Layout

<!-- TODO: Add crafty quote here -->

* Use two **spaces** per indentation level.
  No hard tabs.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred - four spaces
  def some_function do
      do_something
  end

  # preferred
  def some_function do
    do_something
  end
  ```

* Use Unix-style line endings (\*BSD/Solaris/Linux/OSX users are covered by
  default, Windows users have to be extra careful).

* If you're using Git you might want to add the following configuration
  setting to protect your project from Windows line endings creeping in:

  ```sh
  $ git config --global core.autocrlf true
  ```

* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons.
  Do not put spaces around matched pairs like brackets, parentheses, etc.
  Whitespace might be (mostly) irrelevant to the Elixir runtime, but its proper
  use is the key to writing easily readable code.

  ```elixir
  sum = 1 + 2
  {a, b} = {2, 3}
  Enum.map(["one", <<"two">>, "three"], fn num -> IO.puts num end)
  ```

* Use empty lines between `def`s and to break up a function into logical
  paragraphs.

  ```elixir
  def some_function(some_data) do
    altered_data = Module.function(data)
  end

  def some_function do
    result
  end

  def some_other_function do
    another_result
  end

  def a_longer_function do
    one
    two

    three
    four
  end
  ```

* ...but run single-line `def`s that match for the same function together.

  ```elixir
  def some_function(nil), do: {:err, "No Value"}
  def some_function([]), do: :ok
  def some_function([first|rest]) do
    some_function(rest)
  end
  ```

* If you use the `do:` syntax with functions and the line that makes up the
  function body is long, put the `do:` on a new line indented one level more
  than the previous line.

```elixir
def some_function(args),
  do: Enum.map(args, fn (arg) -> arg <> " is on a very long line!" end)
```

When you use the convention above and you have more than one function clause
using the `do:` syntax, put the `do:` on a new line for each function clause:

```elixir
# not preferred
def some_function([]), do: :empty
def some_function(_),
  do: :very_long_line_here

# preferred
def some_function([]),
  do: :empty
def some_function(_),
  do: :very_long_line_here
```

* If you have more than one multi-line `def`s do not use single-line `def`s.

  ```elixir
  def some_function(nil) do
    {:err, "No Value"}
  end

  def some_function([]) do
    :ok
  end

  def some_function([first|rest]) do
    some_function(rest)
  end

  def some_function([first|rest], opts) do
    some_function(rest, opts)
  end
  ```

* Use the pipeline operator (`|>`) to chain functions together.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  String.strip(String.downcase(some_string))

  # preferred
  some_string |> String.downcase |> String.strip

  # Multiline pipelines are not further indented
  some_string
  |> String.downcase
  |> String.strip

  # Multiline pipelines on the right side of a pattern match
  # should be indented on a newline
  sanitized_string =
    some_string
    |> String.downcase
    |> String.strip
  ```

  While this is the preferred method, take into account that copy-pasting
  multiline pipelines into IEx might result in a syntax error, as IEx will
  evaluate the first line without realizing that the next line has a pipeline.

* Use _bare_ variables in the first part of a function chain.

  ```elixir
  # THE WORST!
  # This actually parses as String.strip("nope" |> String.downcase).
  String.strip "nope" |> String.downcase

  # not preferred
  String.strip(some_string) |> String.downcase |> String.codepoints

  # preferred
  some_string |> String.strip |> String.downcase |> String.codepoints
  ```

* Avoid trailing whitespace.


## Syntax

* Use parentheses when you have arguments, no parentheses when you don't. This
  preference holds for both named and anonymous functions. For anonymous
  functions, it's OK to omit parentheses when there is a single argument.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  def some_function arg1, arg2 do
    # body omitted
  end

  def some_function() do
    # body omitted
  end

  some_function = fn arg1, arg2 -> result end
  some_function = fn () -> result end

  # preferred
  def some_function(arg1, arg2) do
    # body omitted
  end

  def some_function do
    # body omitted
  end

  some_function = fn (arg1, arg2) -> result end
  some_function = fn (arg1) -> result end
  some_function = fn arg1 -> result end
  some_function = fn -> result end
  ```

* Never use `do:` for multi-line `if/unless`.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  if some_condition, do:
    # a line of code
    # another line of code
    # note no end in this block

  # preferred
  if some_condition do
    # some
    # lines
    # of code
  end
  ```

* Use `do:` for single line `if/unless` statements.

  ```elixir
  # preferred
  if some_condition, do: # some_stuff
  ```

* Never use `unless` with `else`.
  Rewrite these with the positive case first.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  unless success? do
    IO.puts 'failure'
  else
    IO.puts 'success'
  end

  # preferred
  if success? do
    IO.puts 'success'
  else
    IO.puts 'failure'
  end
  ```

* Always use `true` as the last condition of a `cond` statement.

  ```elixir
  cond do
    1 + 2 == 5 ->
      "Nope"
    1 + 3 == 5 ->
      "Uh, uh"
    true ->
      "OK"
  end
  ```

* Never put a space between a function name and the opening parenthesis.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  f (3 + 2) + 1

  # preferred
  f(3 + 2) + 1
  ```

* Use parentheses in function calls, especially inside a pipeline.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  f 3

  # preferred
  f(3)

  # not preferred and parses as rem(2, (3 |> g)), which is not what you want.
  2 |> rem 3 |> g

  # preferred
  2 |> rem(3) |> g
  ```

* Omit parentheses in macro calls when a do block is passed.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  quote(do
    foo
  end)

  # preferred
  quote do
    foo
  end
  ```

* Optionally omit parentheses in function calls (outside a pipeline) when the
  last argument is a function expression.

  ```elixir
  # preferred
  Enum.reduce(1..10, 0, fn (x, acc) ->
    x + acc
  end)

  # also preferred
  Enum.reduce 1..10, 0, fn (x, acc) ->
    x + acc
  end
  ```


## Naming

* Use `snake_case` for atoms, functions and variables.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  :"some atom"
  :SomeAtom
  :someAtom

  someVar = 5

  def someFunction do
    ...
  end

  def SomeFunction do
   ...
  end

  # preferred
  :some_atom

  some_var = 5

  def some_function do
    ...
  end
  ```

* Use `PascalCase` for modules (keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC, XML uppercase).

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  defmodule Somemodule do
    ...
  end

  defmodule Some_Module do
    ...
  end

  defmodule SomeXml do
    ...
  end

  # preferred
  defmodule SomeModule do
    ...
  end

  defmodule SomeXML do
    ...
  end
  ```

* The names of predicate functions (functions that return a boolean value)
  should have a trailing question mark rather than a leading `is_` or similar.

  ```elixir
  def cool?(var) do
    # checks if var is cool
  end
  ```
* Private functions with the same name as public functions should start with
  `do_`.

  ```elixir
  def sum(list), do: do_sum(list, 0)

  # private functions
  defp do_sum([], total), do: total
  defp do_sum([head|tail], total), do: do_sum(tail, head + total)
  ```

## Comments

* Write self-documenting code and ignore the rest of this section.
  Seriously!

* Use one space between the leading `#` character of the comment and the text of
  the comment.

* Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation.
  Use [one space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) after periods.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  String.upcase(some_string) # Capitalize string.
  ```

* Keep existing comments up-to-date.
  An outdated comment is worse than no comment at all.

* Avoid writing comments to explain bad code.
  Refactor the code to make it self-explanatory.
  ("Do — or do not — there is no try." —Yoda)

### Comment Annotations

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above the
  relevant code.

* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.

* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent lines
  should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would be
  redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line with no
  note.
  This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be added at a
  later date.

* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.

* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause performance
  problems.

* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices were used
  and should be refactored away.

* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it is
  working as intended.
  For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the client does X currently?`

* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be sure to
  document them in your project's `README` or similar.


## Modules

* Use one module per file unless the module is only used internally by another
  module (such as a test).

* Use underscored file names for `CamelCase` module names.

  ```elixir
  # file is called some_module.ex

  defmodule SomeModule do
  end
  ```

* Represent each level of nesting within a module name as a directory.

  ```elixir
  # file is called parser/core/xml_parser.ex

  defmodule Parser.Core.XMLParser do
  end
  ```

* No newline after defmodule.

* No newline before first function def.

* Newline after "module-level-code-blocks".

* Reference other modules in the following order:

    1. `@moduledoc`
    1. `use`
    1. `import`
    1. `alias`
    1. `require`
    1. `@type`
    1. `@module_attribute`

  And, if you're really a perfectionist, sub-sort by alphabetical order. Here's
  an overall example of how you should order things in your modules:

  ```elixir
  defmodule MyModule do
    @moduledoc """
    An example module
    """

    use GenServer
    import Something
    import SomethingElse
    alias My.Long.Module.Name
    alias My.Other.Module.Name
    require Integer

    @type params :: [{binary, binary}]

    @module_attribute :foo
    @other_attribute 100

    ...
  end
  ```


## Documentation

Documentation in Elixir (when read either in `iex` with `h` or generated with
[ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)) uses the [Module Attributes](\
http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/module-attributes.html#as-annotations)
`@moduledoc` and `@doc`.

 * Always include a `@moduledoc` attribute in the line right after `defmodule`
   in your module.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred

  defmodule SomeModule do

    @moduledoc """
    About the module
    """
    ...
  end

  defmodule AnotherModule do
    use SomeModule
    @moduledoc """
    About the module
    """
    ...
  end

  # preferred

  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc """
    About the module
    """
    ...
  end
  ```

 * Use `@moduledoc false` if you do not intend on documenting the module.

  ```elixir
  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc false
    ...
  end
  ```

 * Separate code after the `@moduledoc` with a new line.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred

  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc """
    About the module
    """
    use AnotherModule
  end

  # preferred
  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc """
    About the module
    """

    use AnotherModule
  end
  ```

 * Use heredocs with markdown for documentation.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred

  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc "About the module"
  end

  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc """
    About the module

    Examples:
    iex> SomeModule.some_function
    :result
    """
  end

  # preferred
  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc """
    About the module

    ## Examples

        iex> SomeModule.some_function
        :result
    """
  end
  ```


## Typespecs

Typespecs are notation for declaring types and specifications, for
documentation or for the static analysis tool Dialyzer.

Custom types should be defined at the top of the module with the other
directives (see [Modules](#modules)).

* Place `@typedoc` and `@type` definitions together, and separate each
  pair with a blank line.

  ```elixir
  defmodule SomeModule do
    @moduledoc false

    @typedoc "The name"
    @type name :: atom

    @typedoc "The result"
    @type result :: {:ok, term} | {:error, term}

    ...
  end
  ```

*  If a union type is too long to fit on a single line, add a newline
   and indent with spaces to keep the return types aligned.

  ```elixir
  # not preferred - no indentation
  @type long_union_type :: some_type | another_type | some_other_type
  | a_final_type

  # preferred
  @type long_union_type :: some_type | another_type | some_other_type
                         | a_final_type

  # also preferred - one return type per line
  @type long_union_type :: some_type
                         | another_type
                         | some_other_type
                         | a_final_type
  ```

* Place specifications right before the function definition,
  separated by a newline.

  ```elixir
  @spec some_function(term) :: result
  def some_function(some_data) do
    {:ok, some_data}
  end
  ```


## Exceptions

  * Make exception names end with a trailing `Error`.

    ```elixir
    # not preferred
    defmodule BadHTTPCode do
      defexception [:message]
    end

    defmodule BadHTTPCodeException do
      defexception [:message]
    end

    # preferred
    defmodule BadHTTPCodeError do
      defexception [:message]
    end
    ```

  * Use lowercase error messages when raising exceptions, with no trailing
    punctuation.

    ```elixir
    # not preferred
    raise ArgumentError, "This is not valid."

    # preferred
    raise ArgumentError, "this is not valid"
    ```


## Collections

## Strings

* Match strings using the string concatenator rather than binary patterns:

  ```elixir
  # not preferred
  <<"my"::utf8, _rest>> = "my string"

  # preferred
  "my" <> _rest = "my string"
  ```


## Regular Expressions


## Metaprogramming

* Avoid needless metaprogramming.


## Suggested Alternatives

Suggested alternatives are styles that haven't been seen much in the community
yet but might provide some value.

#### Cond

* An atom can be used as a catch-all expression in a `cond` as it evaluates
  to a truthy value.
  Suggested atoms are `:else` or `:otherwise`

  ```elixir
  cond do
    1 + 2 == 5 ->
      "Nope"
    1 + 3 == 5 ->
      "Uh, uh"
    :else ->
      "OK"
  end

  # is the same as
  cond do
    1 + 2 == 5 ->
      "Nope"
    1 + 3 == 5 ->
      "Uh, uh"
    true ->
      "OK"
  end
  ```
